<h1 style ="background-color:rgb(216, 191, 216); padding: 5px">Nyonya</h1>
<p id="firstpara">Amidst the bustling and loud chatter that fills 8th avenue is Nyonya. The restaurant serves Peranakan or Nyonya cuisine, the unique blend of Chinese, Malaysian, and other Southeast Asian cultures. This cuisine originates from the Peranakans or Straits-born Chinese, descendants of Chinese immigrants who settled in Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia and married local Malays. These descendants formed communities and came to be known as Peranakans - people with local and native ancestry. This mingling of cultures gave birth to the blending of influences and culinary traditions. Techniques, tools, ingredients, and cooking styles are borrowed from each culture and combined to produce diverse and flavorful meals. Today, Nyonya cuisine is a familiar one that many find comfort in.</p>
</p>
<p>
The dishes at Nyonya reflect my Chinese culture: Hainanese chicken, the Princess’s tofu with seafood, Fried rice with salted fish and pineapple, and much more. Likewise, the people who enter Nyonya are similar to my family: Asian American families with younger kids and grandparents sit around round wooden tables. They are all talking with vibrance and excitement, which booms even louder when the food comes out. While sitting with my mom and younger sister, I feel more connected than ever, not just to my family but also to my culture. My mom asks what my sister and I’d like, and we say the usual. The few terms I know in Cantonese leap from my tongue, and she smiles. Our waiter comes to take our order, asking quickly and politely, and scribbling it down. Our chopsticks quietly click as we delicately pick up food. Our teacups clink when the silver metal teapot grazes it to pour in a stream of steaming hot black tea. Our conversation never lingers as we all have things to say and have been waiting for the perfect moment. I look around and see people of different ages and Asian ethnicities smiling and chatting as though forgetting strangers surrounded them. Even though we’re all at separate tables, eating separate food, with separate people, we’re all joined together by Nyonya.
</p>
<p>
Surrounded by similar people of similar backgrounds and upbringing for a change is comforting. Like an irrelevant, miniscule speck in a galaxy, it’s nice knowing that I’m not singled out; I can just disappear into the crowd. The dimly lit space blankets us and our discussion, helping me feel anonymous. Even though I’m different, I’m not isolated for it, but rather welcomed -- we’re all together in our subtle differences. Groups of people, small or big, fill Nyonya, and it becomes evident that these are close relationships filled with love. Embarrassed parents who are on the verge of losing their minds shush their energetic kids with love to be quiet. Exhausted parents let their lively, hyper kids run around the table after having too much lychee soda. Raucous adult friends vent to each other in heavy accents and boisterous voices -- they’re regulars, as the waiters know them all-too-well. Closed-off teenagers sit across from each other and chat in whispers (that you sadly cannot decipher), overshadowed by the others. Grandparents prioritize the younger ones by generously giving them food first and pouring them tea -- they’re the listeners of the conversation. At the same time, their kids or grandkids lead, catching them up on everything they have missed. All of these different relationships, while chaotic sometimes, find Nyonya to be a state of refuge where they can be themselves.
</p>
<p>
Nyonya is a welcoming restaurant that celebrates uniqueness and diversity. It brings together people in their individuality and unites them. It’s a place to step a bit out of our comfort zone and learn about other cultures. It’s a place to witness the little joys and great stepping stones of others’ lives, a place to people-watch and learn their stories. If that is not New York, I do not know what is.
